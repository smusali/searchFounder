## Search Founder

### Description
This repository serves the purpose of being a solution to the take-home assignment given by Dealum. The goal is to look for the founder in the list of founders provided.

### How It Works
It works by running `node index.js <commands>` and the commands can be the combination of the followings:
- `--filepath <filepath>` or `-f <filepath>`: the program looks for the `filepath` and tries to parse the data from the file
- `--list` or `-l`: the program lists all the lines provided after reading the file from `filepath`
- `--search <founder>` or `-s <founder`: the program searches for the `founder` among the lines provided after reading the file from `filepath`

*Happy Coding!*
